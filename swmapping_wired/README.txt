This contains the data that was used for the final analysis and, in particular, for the Wired blog article.

# The data
########################

This data package contains two core pieces of data: (1) the interaction networks for episodes 4 and 8 and (2) the mapping between the characters.

------------------------
- Interaction networks
------------------------

The interaction networks for 4 and 8 were obtained from Evelina Gabasova's github account:

	https://github.com/evelinag/StarWars-social-network/tree/master/networks

They were generated by a program that linked characters together who appeared in the same scene with one another.  Only speaking characters (and R2D2 and BB-8) were included.

The interaction networks are in the files:
	
	- interaction_4.elist
	- interaction_7.elist

These are in edgelist format which means that each line describes an edge between two characters.

--------------------------
- Character mapping
--------------------------

Character mappings are in the file

	character_mapping.txt

The first column is Episode 4, the second column is Episode 8.

Notably, not all characters appear in the character mapping.  When a character
doesn't have a mapping, this just means that the algorithm didn't find a good
match for it in the network.

########################
# How the mapping was done
########################

I used the CGRAAL network alignment method.  There are many alignment methods
out there, all with pros and cons.  CGRAAL felt very well suited to this task
because it was guided entirely by the presence of edges.  Many other methods
assume that the networks contain specific kinds of things (e.g., proteins,
genes) and so they make assumptions that simply don't make sense on a character
interaction network.
